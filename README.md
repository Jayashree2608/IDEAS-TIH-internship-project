# Tuberculosis detection from chest x-ray images using CNN
This project is done for the partial fulfillment of the Data Science Internship conducted by IDEAS-TIH.

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health issue, particularly in resource-limited settings where diagnostic expertise is scarce. This paper presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach for automated TB detection using chest X-ray (CXR) images. The proposed model utilizes pre-trained architectures such as VGG16 and ResNet50 with transfer learning to improve classification accuracy. Trained on a large dataset of CXR images, the model achieved an accuracy of over 90%, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting TB. Techniques such as data augmentation and fine-tuning were employed to address class imbalance and enhance model robustness. The system has the potential to provide rapid, reliable screening for TB, aiding early diagnosis in low-resource areas. Future research will focus on integrating clinical data and expanding testing across diverse populations to further enhance performance.
